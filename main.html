            Hi my name is Joshua Raymond Carter and I am a current junior in highschool. This is my professional website that I made that I hope people take their time to look at. I am 16 and I have a mom, a dad, a sister, and a dog named Ellie. My favorite hobbies are track and field, reading, and playing video games. I do not know what I want to do when I go to college, but I do lan on finding out soon.
